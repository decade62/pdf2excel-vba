# pdf2excel-vba
User Interface in MS Excel that automates the transfer of data from pdf to the spreadsheet.

Points to consider:

- The program detects and defaults to the first available pdf file that exists in the current directory.
- The buttons provide interface assistance. Even when "Hide Interface" is clicked, it will show again next time the file is opened.
